## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (optional but recommended) - Package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patrickwide/elewa-assessment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd elewa-assessment
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using Yarn (or npm):

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

To start the application in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The development server will automatically reload if you make any edits, and you can see any lint errors in the console.

## Technologies Used

### React

This project is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You can learn more about React in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Tailwind CSS

We've used Tailwind CSS for styling the project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly design and customize your UI components. To learn more about Tailwind CSS, check out the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### React Icons

React Icons is used to include a wide variety of icons in the application. You can find more information and usage instructions in the [React Icons documentation](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

### React Router DOM

React Router DOM is used for handling routing in the application. It enables navigation and rendering of different components based on the URL. Learn more about React Router DOM in the [official documentation](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

## Scripts

In this project, you can use the following scripts:

- `yarn start`: Start the development server.
- `yarn build`: Build the app for production.
- `yarn test`: Launch the test runner.
- `yarn eject`: Eject from Create React App (Note: This is a one-way operation, so use it with caution).
